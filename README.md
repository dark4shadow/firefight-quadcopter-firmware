# Firefight Quadcopter Firmware

This project implements firmware for a Raspberry Pi-based quadcopter designed for detecting and extinguishing fires using a powder dispersal method. The quadcopter is equipped with GPS and internet access to locate areas with high CO2 levels and communicate with emergency services.

## Features

- **Fire Detection**: Utilizes CO2 sensors and thermal scanners to identify potential fire sources.
- **Powder Dispersal**: Implements a mechanism for dispersing fire suppression powder.
- **GPS Navigation**: Uses GPS for precise navigation and location tracking.
- **Manual Control**: Allows operators to manually control the quadcopter when necessary.
- **Emergency Communication**: Communicates with emergency services to report fire locations and status.
- **Automatic Return**: Automatically returns to the base for recharging when battery levels are low.
