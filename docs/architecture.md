# Architecture of the Firefight Quadcopter Firmware

## Overview
The Firefight Quadcopter Firmware is designed to enable a Raspberry Pi-based quadcopter to autonomously detect and extinguish fires using a powder dispersal method. The system integrates various sensors, communication modules, and control algorithms to achieve its objectives.

## Components

### 1. Core System
- **AppContext**: Manages the overall application state and configuration settings.
- **DroneStateMachine**: Handles the different operational states of the drone, including idle, patrol, investigate, extinguish, and return to base.

### 2. Navigation and Control
- **NavigationManager**: Responsible for managing flight paths and navigation using GPS data.
- **ManualInterface**: Provides manual control capabilities for the operator, allowing for direct intervention when necessary.

### 3. Sensors
- **CO2Analyzer**: Measures CO2 levels in the environment to detect potential fire hazards.
- **GPSReceiver**: Retrieves GPS data for accurate positioning and navigation.
- **ThermalScanner**: Detects heat sources to locate potential fires.

### 4. Actuators
- **MotorController**: Controls the quadcopter's motors for flight maneuvers.
- **PowderDispersal**: Manages the dispersal of fire suppression powder when a fire is confirmed.

### 5. Communication
- **TelemetryLink**: Sends telemetry data back to the base station for monitoring and analysis.
- **EmergencyChannel**: Facilitates communication with emergency services to report detected fires and request assistance.

### 6. Services
- **BatteryManager**: Monitors battery status and manages charging and power consumption.
- **ReturnToBase**: Implements logic for returning to the base station for recharging when battery levels are low.

## Workflow
1. **Initialization**: The firmware initializes all components, sets up communication channels, and prepares sensors for operation.
2. **Patrol Mode**: The quadcopter autonomously patrols designated areas, using GPS for navigation and CO2 levels for fire detection.
3. **Fire Detection**: Upon detecting high CO2 levels or thermal signatures, the quadcopter transitions to investigate the source.
4. **Fire Confirmation**: The system confirms the presence of a fire using multiple sensors and begins the extinguishing process.
5. **Extinguishing**: The powder dispersal mechanism is activated to suppress the fire.
6. **Return to Base**: After completing its mission or when battery levels are low, the quadcopter returns to the base for recharging.

## Conclusion
The Firefight Quadcopter Firmware is a robust system designed for effective fire detection and suppression. By leveraging advanced sensors and communication technologies, it aims to enhance firefighting efforts and improve safety in fire-prone areas.
