# Emergency Communications Protocols and Procedures

This document outlines the communication protocols and procedures for the firefighting quadcopter to effectively notify emergency services in the event of detecting high CO2 levels or potential fires.

## Overview

The quadcopter is equipped with a communication system that allows it to send alerts and data to emergency services. This system is crucial for ensuring timely responses to fire incidents and for coordinating with ground teams.

## Communication Components

1. **Emergency Channel**: 
   - The `EmergencyChannel` class is responsible for establishing a reliable communication link with emergency services.
   - It utilizes both cellular and Wi-Fi networks to ensure connectivity in various environments.

2. **Telemetry Link**:
   - The `TelemetryLink` class sends real-time data regarding the quadcopter's status, location, and detected hazards.
   - This data is crucial for situational awareness and decision-making by emergency responders.

## Procedures

### 1. Detection of High CO2 Levels

- Upon detecting CO2 levels above a predefined threshold, the quadcopter will:
  - Log the event and the corresponding GPS coordinates.
  - Initiate communication with the emergency services via the `EmergencyChannel`.
  - Send a notification that includes:
    - The type of hazard detected (e.g., high CO2 levels).
    - The exact location (latitude and longitude).
    - Timestamp of the detection.

### 2. Fire Detection

- If a potential fire is detected using the thermal scanner:
  - The quadcopter will confirm the detection through multiple readings.
  - Once confirmed, it will:
    - Log the fire's location and intensity.
    - Notify emergency services with the following information:
      - Type of fire (if identifiable).
      - Location coordinates.
      - Estimated size and intensity of the fire.
      - Any additional relevant data from onboard sensors.

### 3. Manual Override

- In case of manual control activation:
  - The operator can send emergency alerts directly through the manual interface.
  - The system will provide options to report specific incidents or request assistance.

### 4. Automatic Return to Base

- If the battery level drops below a critical threshold or if the quadcopter is instructed to return:
  - The system will notify emergency services of the quadcopter's return status.
  - It will provide the last known location and any ongoing incidents before returning to the base for recharging.

## Conclusion

The emergency communication protocols are designed to ensure that the firefighting quadcopter can effectively relay critical information to emergency services, enhancing the overall response to fire incidents. Regular testing and updates to the communication system will be conducted to maintain reliability and efficiency.
